# GBZ80AsmCondenser

The goal of this project is to make gbz80 asm easier to follow. It may turn into a disassembly project at some point.

This will be done with the following steps:\
The first step will write psuedo-code.\
The second step will go through and delete assignments that are not needed.\
The third step will condense the psuedo-code.\
